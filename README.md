# MCUnitTests, Learning xUnit Testing in .NET/C#

## Description
This project serves as a hands-on learning experience for xUnit testing in the .NET/C# environment. The solution comprises a basic web API intentionally designed to return nothing, providing a practical playground for understanding and implementing xUnit tests.

## Key Features
The primary goal of this project is to offer a practical platform for enhancing skills in xUnit testing within the .NET framework.

## How It Looks
The project consists of a straightforward web API with minimal functionality, deliberately kept simple to focus on the nuances of writing effective xUnit tests. The test suite covers various scenarios, demonstrating the application of xUnit concepts such as Arranging, Acting, and Assertions (AAA).

## Usage
Feel free to explore and run the tests. Contributions, feedback, and improvements are always welcome!
